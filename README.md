"I start analyzing data with Business Understanding and Data Understanding. I then check for missing values. The next step is univariate data analysis. Data preparation is crucial for understanding the structure of the data. Afterward, I build predictive models using various machine learning algorithms, such as:
Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression with Regularization
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classifier
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
Finally, I evaluate the best-fitting model on the data using various tools."
